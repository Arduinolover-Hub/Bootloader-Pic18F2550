# Bootloader-Pic18F2550
Build a bootloader board with the Pic 18f2550, which you will able to program your microcontroller directly from your PC to the board.
This is a small board which use the well know Pic18F2550, this microcontroller is easy to find in the electronic stores and most of the electronics hobbyist have one of them in their stock. So in this opportunite We are going to build a develpment board, which means that will have all the neccesary to work and test our codes and projects.

The board module, with the Bootloader firmware, can work in two modes of operation: "Bootloader" mode in which it is ready to be programmed, and "User" mode in which the application program is automatically executed. Both modes are availableautomaticallyonceweconnectedtheboard.
